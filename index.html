            <h3>Open flight Project</h3>
            <h4>University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</h4>
            <p>Main tools & skills: C++</p>
            <p>Project background: Used flight routes and airports data to create a tool to help travel enthusiasts find the best way to travel. Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm assists in finding the shortest routes by airport while Tarjan's strongly connected component algorithm and DFS help discover a cluster of places that can be visited.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Traversal: Simulated an extreme version of "Around the World in 80 Days", where users could visit each airport without repeating it.</li>
                <li>Shortest Path: Used Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two airports; utilized a priority queue and followed the idea of adding and removing nodes from the priority queue based on the shortest time to traverse between the two nodes being compared.</li>
                <li>Landmark Routes: Created routes that include common tourist destinations; selected the airport and built the route accordingly.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Image and Stickers Project</h3>
            <h4>University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</h4>
            <p>Main tools & skills: C++</p>
            <p>Project background: Made a class to represent an image with stickers placed on it. The stickers placed on the base image might hang off any side of the base image while avoiding to cover other stickers. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Located everything relative to the base Image since the base Image is on an infinite canvas  </li>
                <li>Maintained an array of pointers to Image objects to store the stickers. Each Image in the Sticker Sheet had an index, an x-coordinate, and a y-coordinate.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>DNA Database Project</h3>
            <h4>University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</h4>
            <p>Main tools & skills: Java</p>
            <p>Project background: Determined DNA affiliation given the name of a DNA database file and a string representation of the DNA sequence.  </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accumulated experience by iterating compound data structures and made decisions based on observed values </li>
                <li>Enriched experience with simple string parsing and basic string manipulation techniques</li>
                <li>Employed reading data from a file using input Files streams</li>
                <li>Practiced with simple string parsing and basic input validation,and further developed Linux programming and shell command</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Connect 4 Project</h3>
            <h4>University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</h4>
            <p>Main tools & skills: Java</p>
            <p>Project background: Built the game Connect 4 and 4 automated models to win the game. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Worked on a team development project; tasked with implementing the game Connect 4 </li>
                <li>Implemented a subset of functionality required for gameplay. </li>
